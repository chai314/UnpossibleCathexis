# Owo What's This

This is the 3-week introductory course on Metamathematics I ran as part of Polygon's first ever Winter Projects. It aims to introduce logic and metamath and drops various historical sidenotes and tidbits along the way, culminating in a project utilizing interactive theorem provers such as Lean. It is research heavy and carries a lot of required readings. The resources it points to have been hyperlinked.

The lazy renderer in my experience tries to cut down on quality. A remedy I've identified is to zoom in.
