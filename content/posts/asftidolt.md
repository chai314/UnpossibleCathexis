Right now it’s the last day of 2024, and I’m sitting in solitude for perhaps the first time since Christmas, killing the two hours between a third snooze that sliced in half a dozing which had been delicious for a mess breakfast which was less so, and the consequent refractory period until I can sleep again by trying to summon up in a parody of DFW’s *ASFTINDA* a kind of hypnotic sensuous collage of all the stuff I’ve seen and heard and done as a result of the Inter-IIT Cultural Meet just ended.

I have sat for sixty hours in a couple of trains and deigned grudgingly to a détente with roaches in both rides, contesting them for territory and marking off mine with a curtain. 

I have witnessed the pace of aisle vendors in the trainway and with outstretched arms only ever seen them from the backside, zooming away purposefully from my 3TAC carriage into the next. 

I have gotten off on at least five stations for tea and croissants, and briefly been part of a trio of troublemakers in scouring the station for snacks, collecting scoldings in surplus and in spades from a jittery secretary (ahem, CL) and unimpressed exec-loungers alike. 

Shamefully, intermittently, in those peripatetic periods I wandered dehydrated and starved, I have deemed exorbitant rates justified for filling foods, cold and simple and common[^1].

I have laughed the loudest after these food hunts when making a run for it at the beckoning horn of the fleeing Capital Express awakening with a roar at its fleeting stops.

I have dreamed in daylight and yawned and dawdled in the bus’s whir and hum, limbered and loosened up languorously, and yawned some more until it hurt as we slowly rolled through the stretches of a 40km long trucker protest for three whole hours.

I have bitten my lip and refused government-sanctioned *edibles* from a rustic, inconspicuous little shoppe outside campus. 

I have tried my first Litti Chokha and scarfed the stew down with a radish stick. 

I have been notified of my catachresis of *Malayalam* and *Malayali* on enough occasions to warrant a vow of sticking to “Mallu”.

I have committed to heart an assortment of choice words and invectives so taboo they beget public flagellation with trumpet fanfare in all of Kerala and some parts of Tamil Nadu. 

I have picked a fitting outfit and learned what to do with my hands on stage only twenty minutes before performing. I have forgotten lines twice, on stage, and what I ad-libbed to immediately cover up must have been instinct or spinal cord or the three *Sting*s in my belly because I sure as hell wasn’t thinking.

I have had, in waiting for my turn to perform, my first panic attack. Racing heart, intense needles, sudorific triggers, breathless hypoxia, the see-your-soul-waving-”byeee” kind of breakdown that glimmers prankfully, in absolute maleficence.

I’ve been informed by friends of friends of a girl from IITP who saw me perform and has sought my contact ever since; just who is unclear and I’m afraid that went nowhere.

In conversing with a congenial and mutually impressed slam poet of IITI who ran around the stage as he spoke and ran after me and caught me when I left, in the face of his honeyed encomia against my embarrassed apiaries I have come to realize the meaning of “*kutte nu gheo nahi pachda*”. 

I have ranked third in Slam and suspect that there is some amorphous, muddied ice where the nodes of festivity and celebration ought to lie in my heart: it didn’t move me one bit.

I have been the only one grinning in the English Story Writing hall and the first to pick up the pen when the theme was revealed to be *Time*. I will admit to having thrown a private tantrum when my work was judged second-best (with a three-way tie for *best*). 

I have overcome and found closure (by triumphing, how else?) to a year-long, parasocial, obsessive Story Writing rivalry with someone I should have forgotten in 30 minutes. It is infinitely relieving. My familiar, I’m afraid, has picked up two new ones, christened Gora Chachundar, and Zeus ka/ki Condom.

It is my quixotic hope that the judge for Slam Poetry had graded our other artiste 16/15 on account of not superficial human error but of rather having been blown utterly away by her exemplary display. 

I have only on the day of the TLC Quiz found out that its L doesn’t stand for or have much to do with language or literature.

We have in a temporary group of four on a shadowy street at three a.m. under the tar-black predawn sky been challenged by three Nilgais standing tall in our path, and decided as a group to tip our hats and take a bow despite having numerical advantage, to turn back, undaunted, but out of respect for the antelopes’ unfettered verve despite vegetarianism and warfaring spirit, their silence, their fire.

Dangerously I have dared to wonder amidst and after attending stand-up comedy (in lieu of the ongoing JAM, forgive me Vishal, but it was impossibly boring): “*I think I could do this*”.

I have unfortunately overheard mischief-laden plans of violating mascot Neelzo on multiple days in myriad ways.

I have marveled at the Hand of Fate fully invested in toying with a dude, this lucky, plucky, klutz going 6-for-7 at finding his lost bottle and losing it again and finding it again ad naus. in the span of only one week, and have become compoundingly confounded at his folly each time he has dropped the very same bottle somewhere and forgotten where exactly, but I've been all the more amused and astounded at his fortune, the sheer luck of the bottle finding its way back to him every single time (at least for the first six times) from distant places and different people like a heat-seeking, remote-activated, (bottle-shaped) boomerang.

I now know what a sitter is, and have gained a perspective of admiration and distaste in equal parts for the sitters of IITKGP: disdain and contempt for their perverted job as lackeys, as pawns, as stooges, as minions, filming forever and always and mindlessly and obediently, gathering and accumulating mountains of evidence for stupid and downright irreverent contentions; a certain visceral disgust towards KGP’s miserable smugness at being the fattest crab in the barrel, but irrefutable acknowledgment of force for their steering and commandeering the helms from beneath the shadows, shoving and quaking and confusing rankings in all events from behind the scenes, the micro-optimizing and macro-mismanaging and the maliciously maladaptive allegation of “muh OC”/“durrr OC goes brr” which they deliver as a gentle, predictable, periodic and timely enema to every event and performance while the contention meet’s still fresh.

I have with vigor and gusto and a scar or two to remember it by, bled, and won against myself.

I have made it a mental point to always pack a towel from now on, having tiptoed on coals of cold into the bathroom on headwash day, consciously straining and angling torso to minimize unwanted body-to-water contact, walking away with aches in brand new places and a very wet head to fan-dry on a December evening.

<!-- Only the Bikini Bottom duo remain as I write. -->

I have talked successfully to our ultimate bus driver (who had spent some time in Madras) with what broken Mallu I now speak, before stopping to realize that that conversation was aided and only truly made possible by the fact that the guy had been fully baked, zooting, chilling on the Moon the whole time. Our bus driver, for the very last ride. The final twist being *Final Destination*… never before have I dialed home that quickly, or to tell them how I love them.

I have felt seventeen again.

To “Guys, \[since\] we’ve all grown closer thanks to Inter-IIT in these past seven days \[...blah…blah…\]”, I have said No Way, 

and meant Yes.
