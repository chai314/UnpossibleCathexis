*Naught would fetch me rapture purer than knowing your tomb is simply bursting at the seams, what with all the motion inside; roll in your grave like the clown you were, Bard, for her name was a thousand melodies.*

A gentle summer day in May when the heat-stricken hum and buzz of cicadas seemed to quiver in my eardrums like a slightly tinned tuning fork, I was taking a new street as I did those times when I felt particularly adventurous, and would have absolutely driven past her block if it weren’t for the sudden crashing of a tree into my bonnet at around fifty kilometers an hour – if willows were walkers then the rascal ran like a redwood. Vagrantly, my eyes had stayed in a fateful faux-pas glued to curious marouflage: that raiment adorned with hieroglyphs and the fulgent face it accompanied, politely etching itself into my memory as I passed out in a cradle of smoke and the comfort of airbags.

*Huff.* Yes, I’d love some water. That’d be H2O. *Sip.* Much better – thank you.

I came to to the sight of an unknown ceiling. She sat by the bedpost, caressing crinkles in the sheets in sweet insouciance. I was told she pulled me out of the ruins of my Cadillac (okay, the Cad was dad’s, on the verge of breakdown for a preternatural decade and yet hellaciously chic for the zeitgeist. Repairs weren’t bad. Well, they were, but I digress) in a show of sheer power I could have only hoped to fathom correctly, because those slender arms and tender hands didn’t give the impression of as much as a delusion of the illusion of an iota of strength. Smidgeons for wrists perfumed with treacle; amaretto. I could have wrapped around each with a thumb and a pinkie, I swear. 

And *quelle coïncidence*, she was nineteen too. Let’s cut the gory details – there were sparks. We got together. *Sip.* We were tabasco of infinite zest, arson to vineyards doused in dandelions and roars of fiery dread, fuelled by a wick woven of scarlet Fate that seemed to rend latitudes and longitudes into fantastic shreds. Ah, it was dynamite, in the kilotons.

I’m not sure, but, do you have this concept of a “reversal”, over there? And oh, no offense.   
I see. It’s rather simple – we’re attracted to impressive appearances: qualities in resonance with our biases, that float our figurative boats, are attuned to our proclivities, make us feel valid and three-dimensional and so on. It’s evolutionary; Darwinian – or your equivalent version. You get the idea. And then comes the aforementioned *reversal*. It’s a spectacular shift in paradigm, a real festival for the feelings when it finally occurs. No longer do you like solely the likable matter, for you've learned to like all that one has to offer: the quirks and the idiosyncrasies, all the issues and the baggage.

I reversed for her. 

She was the Day God made the oceans so the September breeze could bear her locks adrift and season them with seaside mists. We sauntered on beaches with naked heels dipping in the wet sand, laughing ridiculously, scolding bawdy zephyrs for teasing the grip on her sunhat until the lapis lazuli dome of the sky relaxed to languid pumpkin. She was the sublime Evenfall we cleaned our ankles mutedly, replete kilns of flaring youth now mellow and warm as the dulcet tunes of the last train home dopplering into the sunset. We lay on cloth under umbrellas on the silica and quietly lunched al fresco. She was the stellar Midnight we lay there simply talking, hushing the stars to keep our secrets. *Sip.* Getting flustered and feelings-y, and all.

Those glyphs on her shirt? Apparently, she’d believed with all her heart there were others like us among the stars… Aliens. Liked to deadpan that they were all sorta silly and took emotions very seriously and would brutally slaughter over a simple lie or hurt feeling. Cute as a button. I loved all her silly thoughts… I’d reversed for her after all. She saw me, thoroughly, as did I her. But she made me valid. My love peaked.

And in time, hers subdued. 

She’d go on rationalizing and emotionalizing and tell me how much she cared but that there was just not much left now where once stood fecund pastures of deciduous leaves. Every seventh grader knows the second law of thermodynamics, and that’s just how it is sometimes – I understood that. I wished excruciatingly she could’ve too. 

There were, however, deciduous teeth. I wouldn’t ever know why exactly we bickered, so often we’d meta-quarrel over my alleged lack of verve in trying to beat the wind. She would supply me with reasons I’d never get, and rip out hair elaborating, and elucidating, and ultimately give up saying she’d rather have read Shakespeare to a pigeon. 

The man’s my anathema, you see. I wish for a long and painful death, or swift and solemn demise at hands that mean me serious harm, if ever comes the day I show him the tiniest indivisible atom of reference, let alone reverence, by so much as reciting a single damned quote residing within his loquacious libraries of verbose nonsense. I would like slices of my throat to be served on a platter to starving carnivores. Cannibals would do just as well. I would like to be hung for good after a total of six failed attempts, each time a different kind of knot about my skin, geometric grids of my bruises whispering *welcome* to ultimate asphyxia.

I’m not suicidal, be assured, but I fear the prospect of my brains splattering into grotesque mush would tempt me if ever were I coerced to recite him in a dark alley with pistol steel and muzzle pressing against my cranium. I loathe the man with the intensity of a supernova presaging the ungodly, \-imaginable, \-fathomable finale of everything as we know it and as we don’t and all there is and all there isn’t. But I digress. *Sip.*

We stopped feeling particularly adventurous in my Cad. My desperate attempts at switching context, manifesting perhaps in the form of honeyed compliments, were apparently hollow and patronising, how precedented. But the great *miliaria rubra* on my back was attempting to engage, only to be told off for space, and then informed that I had never been around when my being around had been imperative. I’d stopped feeling very valid or three-dimensional for a while.

It started creeping up to me. Something unwelcome and unwanted. Felt like charcoal shrapnel boring soot into my fingernails, like an onslaught of crows with horned beaks gouging away at my hide, ripping off pustules of blood and viscera. The blackness would take over my thoughts at the very sight of her, my sight at the very thought of her. Always, it'd offer to drive me There.

Have you ever been There? I think I did for an instant. I saw myself in crimson and heard the incessant screeching of the stars, the constant noise of Entropy itself, tearing my mind, my brain, my very metaphysical being into shards, subdividing those shards into fragments, shattering those fragments into domains, ad naus. until I was a throbbing fractal painted in a sanguine infinity of the Universe’s true color: pain.

I spent an ample attosecond There.

I conceded. Drove my final drive through her block, past the rascal redwood I would have set alight if I’d had to stay there any longer. Never told her. It was for good, the best choice for both of us. She stood there wistfully, sentential abortions apparent in her convulsing larynx, all poignant and cinematic with puppy dog eyes finding no luck in straining for tears. A defeatist till the very end.

The punchline, or the epilogue, is that I don’t resent her one bit – believe it or not. Nineteen is basically kindergarten, after all. And the best mistakes are the unforgettable sort, from a pedagogical as well as a strangely makes-you-feel-fortunate-in-retrospect perspective. Besides, we loved like adults. We really saw each other. And we extinguished it with mutual respect. Put me through sixty stages of grief, really, but I wouldn’t give up these fond memories for anything. 

I can say without a doubt that true romance exists on Earth. Hell, we’d yank it into existence from up the Void’s heiney on any other planet just as well. *Self-love*, I say\! I won’t bother with further bromides, except maybe one: Humanity is an invariant Romance, an ode to itself. I insist you learn more. Check out my bestseller, won’t you? It’s called, The Cur—

And pause\! Is the button the Plaintiff Attorney pushes on a clunky remote, freezing inanimate the testifying Human mid-speech. The Attorney bows in a flexible arch of slime to the dais as if to say *words, words are no longer needed*. The Judge of the Intergalactic Sidereal Court stands to strike four golden buzzers with brio and panache and hammers in four arms, making exuberant illumination effulgently infiltrate the exteriors and interims of the entire square-lightyear courtroom[^1].

The end of the Human’s monologue is met with trumpet fanfare as a thousand cannons burst, luminiferous projectiles duly disintegrating into billowing blooms of crescent confetti. The audience spasms and churns and gets up to run in circles clockwise, then counterclockwise, yelling “Reversal\!” and grinning like apes on the bus. The glazed panel of Jurors gazes vacantly into outer space with gaping mouths ajar, their jovian taste-buds jutting. Threnodies are wailed, for this court has properly had its sentiments stirred.

The pathos is overwhelming, but the agents of the devil know better than to surrender their cool: Defendant Attorneys, that sly and senescent and stiff-jointed bunch is huddled into a heap trying to clutch through this tooth-and-bone crisis for their stand. Striking hot iron, the Plaintiff adjusts his slick young hair, flicking a molecule of lint off his impeccable slacks, and grabs the mic:

“Aren’t humans droll? Every century we renew this very trial, and they prove time and again that their affective capabilities are astounding; confounding; that the top-percentile representative of their young is sufficiently developed for true emotional connection viz. Galactic Sentience Standard IEEE754. We vehemently conclude that the defendants’ bidding to use the Earth as ceremonial sacrifice for their interstellar highway project is, indubitably, immoral, and incredibly ignominious at that.”

It seems that legal speech excites no audience in the universe. The Plaintiff goes at it again for at least a crumb of clout:

“We plead for cessation of further renewals of this trial. Shan’t we vie to finally lift this recurring curse from the Solar system’s youngest planet? Defendants will resort to conservative excuses, like galactic heritage and the preservation thereof. We reinforce and urge the necessity of putting one of the older planets on the altar.”

“Enough has been said. Do the Defendants wish to leave their huddle yet?” thunders the loudest voice in the courtroom.

“They… We do, milord. We wish to mildly interrogate the top-percentile.”  
“Sustained. Let him be unpaused.”

“Mr &#x25A0;&#x25A0;&#x25A0;.”  
“Yes, spaceman? No offense, there.”

“None taken here. We’d like to know just a little about your adventures in love.”  
“Sweet. An interview.”

“Especially your inspiring capacity for true emotional connection.”  
“Don’t embarrass me now. Shoot.”

“Verily. Among all the adulation, it seems that this court didn’t learn much about Ms  <u>&#9675;&#9675;&#9675;</u> at all.”  
“Who?”

“Mister &#x25A0;&#x25A0;&#x25A0;?”  
“...”

“...”  
“Who else\! Just an Earth joke for you, ha…”

“...”  
“ ...Kinda nippy here, eh?”

“Yes.” The court falls silent, lifeless, transfixed with a gaze feral as the Universe. 

“What’s in a name, as they say back Home.”
