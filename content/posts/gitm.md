*Her gaze is transfixed on diamonds in the bed of the night sky. Her calculations: immaculate. She is clockwork. Not the passage of a single attosecond goes unnoticed when her mind hits top performance. She is mechanical. She is gears meshing and cogs spinning. Her mind is a lens of the astronomical and the infinitesimal. She is calculus. Paradox is her diet and antinomies her breakfast. Legends say her timekeeping accounts for quantum effects. Her lifestyle is furtive; her existence a hush, a secret only whispered. She measures flawlessly. The stars stay in place, it is said, out of sheer terror at the prospect of incurring her disfavor, her silent, vicious fury. She is Celeste, the last timekeeper of Greenwich. She solves Time.*

I learn firsthand that the ciliary musculature, like most muscles in your body, has a tendency to tire and ache having to adjust the optic lens to the vicissitudes of bright-and-dark illumination for long enough. Shut eyelids my bare defense against this vexing vacillation of offs and ons, I focus on the fragrance in the air: a close race between the two escorts escorting me to the gala over which one smells better. Can’t decide. A dead heat.

Of course there’s an elevator. The enigmatic kind with only one button; one that accelerates so drowsily it’s easy to forget which way it’s going. It *is* moving though, and I have that barotraumatic ringing to testify for it. The three of us get off into much more dolce lighting that can only be described as the February dawn; soothing; a lullaby for the eye. 

The carpet is fauna. Or plant fiber. Hell, it might be dollar bills. Clearly I'm no connoisseur but I can tell from its depression and spring that whatever this is, it’s expensive. Perhaps a small animal could confuse it for a very comfortable trampoline. And if I thought this was impressive –

– I spoke too soon. The escorts escorting me are escorted off by second order escorts: escort escorts, i.e escorts of escorts. If that isn’t enough of a headache, there’s the escorts’ escorting area and the escort escorts’ escorting area and apparently they’re separate. I decide not to dwell on it further in the interest of not having my brain spontaneously escor– er… explode.

Here’s a crowd, the ultra rich variety. A hot minute in and I’m getting sized up by gazes aimed at undressing the ostensible, seeming to expose my façade with murmured undertones that alternate between “urchin”, and “look, one of the *help* is in a different uniform”, as if they see right through my lineage, transparent as glacial lakes of liquid glass, surmising at one glance that this crass, earthy pedestrian is the son of probably the village tailor or such, crippled in pedigree, an imposter. All this, despite the bespoke suit you stitched for me, Dad. I’m so sorry. I love you.

The susurration of conversation refined fills the air, a hum-like white noise over the jazz piano. The February dawn is just as soothing still, low and warm as it casts a haze over the sea of guests – guests dressed exuberantly à la mode, guests appearing as though each has been conjured from the pages of Vogue. I can stand here and adore this sight all day, with how the lighting is particularly playful from my vantage point, seeming to blend shadows and blur colors in a luscious display of legerdemain. It’s romantic, as if time doesn’t exist anymore. I almost forget why I’m here in the first place, and I have to whack my cheeks cherry red to snap back. I need this internship… it’ll turn my life around.

But first I’ll need this champagne. One glass, just to calm my nerves. I’m handed a drink with a name I can’t pronounce. My heart is afoot and has already crawled its way up to my throat, and my anxieties are growing too lurid, too amphetaminic to stabilize on my own. More looks – I guess *bottoms up* isn’t exactly etiquette.

It begins to kick in and I decide I have a little time to check out the chocolatier’s station. The chocolatier himself has a sullied, off-white glow. Strikingly it resembles that feeling of ripping open a fresh pair of briefs on New Year’s and being punched in your face expectant of the factory odor of sterilized fabric with instead the sight of your new undergarment desecrated, laden with pubic hair of mysterious origin, chock full to the point of dissipating on touch like the dispersive seeds of the Himalayan balsam or pyroclastic flow clouds from a volcano’s surging muzzle. You know what I mean?

Someone taps my shoulder lightly. It’s a figure almost too perfectly dressed, a man with a vintage look out of some noir kinography. The hull of his form vignettes with all that is black in the world. A knowing smile tiptoes on his face.

 "I see you’re pleased with our sommelier\!" he declaims.

Oops – I’m carrying two glasses. How did that happen, haha. Flustered, I keep one at the chocolatier’s desk, who carries it off with a confused look. This man, Mr Noir, let’s call him, has a sort of coruscating gleam to him. He’s also the owner of this skyscraper, ipso facto my prospective employer, and per the way serendipity works, exactly the man I’m here to meet.

Part of me realizes that the phatic conversation I make as my first impression right now will amount to the preponderance of my likelihood at getting the gig: Chief Lighting Officer, *Directeur Exécutif de Lumière* (Luminary Executive Director, the ‘L.E.D.’) of the Noir skyscraper. The undressing looks from earlier worked, however, and I’m pretty sure I bombed it. Wet the bed and hung the sheets to dry, forgot the clothespin, saw them drift with the wind, waved goodbye. Still trying to slip in that Kerouac quote was a disaster and a half too.

Well, I’ve gone ahead and done it. I’ve brought shame to the whole village. I wonder if I should go back home in the first place, or weave a white lie… or a couple hundred. For the time being I pour myself something harder and make my way to that spot in the room from earlier, and I notice what I hadn’t yet noticed: all the way across the hall sits a slim chamber door, half-ajar, seeping through which is an almost invisible glow, but a glow no doubt. How’d I miss this?

Beyond the chamber door lies an intimate little lounge and though sans sack and simian, the little fuchsia-donning-cartoon-adventurer-Latina side of me takes the liberty to conduct a quick impromptu exploration. Force of habit draws my attention to the area’s luminary personality, with its contrasts filtered like Tyndall’s effect through the bowl of a wine glass. 

It’s dream-like. I like it.

A single figure sits at the end of the room, obscured in the chiaroscuro, nursing a drink of her own, her back to the door.

“An observant one. *Entrez*.” The figure turns slowly to face me. She has the quiet air of someone unbothered, a presence that makes the walls feel too close. A slim gold wristwatch peeks from beneath the sleeve of her gown, etched with tiny, moving constellations. She gestures to the door and I shut it.

“Do you know who you’re speaking to?” she asks, baring a faint smile through her indifferent composure.

I shake my head. “Should I?”

“*Non*. We can chat, if you have the time.”

I make a bland joke cursing Time but she’s amused. She asks me what else I hate about time, and I’m not too guarded at the moment so I begin to bloviate. End up spilling my guts. I put half the blame on her for being too easy to talk to, and the other half on all the intoxicants I’ve had until this point. 

Appreciably, she lacks the imposing air of the crowd from earlier and it’s somewhat refreshing. I confide that I’m here seeking internship in the tower (She’s not a competitor, she confirms. Works at the tower, and her job is to, as she puts it, “solve” matters), and how I technically lied in the application which was open exclusively to Greenwich city natives because I’m from Greenwich village, which isn’t even in the same country, and how Dad took three full days of leave from work to stitch this suit up for his little boy leaving for the big city, and how it was the sweetest gift ever, and how I’m trying to find the gall to tell him how utterly I’ve clowned his faith.

She nods as if in consideration, and shoots me a curious look, inquiring: “Luminary Director. A strange job, don’t you think?”

I say that it’s perfect for me because I was born with supernumerary photoreceptors, and I can notice the glow of things that don’t glow according to general consensus. My slurred memory hits a lacuna here, but I vaguely remember Light and Time, the solitude of sundials and laughing at lightyears, the whatsits of Planck and Einstein’s whatnots, and how photons don’t experience time due to the Lorentz factor blowing up or something. I think she particularly loathes atomic clocks… idiosyncratic, I know, but who am I to talk? She asks if she has a glow, and I think for a while, and finally disclose that it’s like starlight.

“Starlight.” She repeats, gaze falling forlornly to her wristwatch, with its constellations in gold.

“Of diamonds in the bed of the night sky” she whispers to herself, gaze yet fallen, but I catch it.

“No, of spiders exploding like stars across the firmament.” Thank you, Kerouac. She looks at me, suddenly, animated in awe I can’t explain. She’s clearly pleased and I haven’t the slightest as to why, but no ounce of me can say no when she pulls out her personal bottle of… no, still can’t pronounce it. She pours me some, and my hippocampus really hoists the surrender flag at this point, as my sense of time dissolves. Corrupted wisps of a conversation remain.

“You’re neither light, nor time.”

“So I’m both…”

“No, dunderhead. Humans can’t march forward incessantly. We hit walls sometimes.”

“Walls hurt. What would Light do?”

“Reflect off.”

“What would Time do?”

“She’s on sabbatical. Drinks and lazes in a lounge these days.”

“What should I do? City lights gelid, so hostile… home, light warm.”

“Warm as a wet sheet in the wind?”

“Forget that, please.”

“Home or here. Choose.”

“I haven’t given up just yet.”

“You embarrassed yourself.”

“And yet.”

“Very well. When you see Noir, tell him C↗■⨖⠏⍓⯎ sent… actually, you’re not in the condition, are you.”

“...”

“Another solution, is in order.”

“…”

“Hmm.”

…

Memory haze; curse the liquor. Where am I?

I try to get up but my leg won’t respond. Yeah, it’s broken.

“Yeah, that’s broken” declaims the figure of Mr Noir, sitting down next to my immobile body on the animal/plant/currency carpet. He only speaks in declamations, I realize.

The walls have been lowered on the North side to reveal a helipad extending from the billionaire’s tower, which (the helipad) is itself as large as a small squash farm, no kidding. He catches me up: apparently, I was admiring the upper balcony view in unbounded inebriation. I promptly tripped, and fell, and landed onto the chocolatier, snapping his spine like a Kit Kat, passing out.

“I’m so, so sorry, I-”

“You’ve saved my life, tonight you have.”

“...I’m sorry?”

He draws my attention to a group of escort escorts tossing the chocolatier into a pile of neutralized partygoers. I’m told they were armed and planning a heist, and my sporadic entry really threw them into panic, breaking their *Professor*’s back, and all.

Knew that chocolatier was no good.

A heavy-duty helicopter airlifts an ambulance into the landing area. I’m loaded into it, Noir walks in, and as we take off I don’t wonder why the ambulance was needed in the first place, because starless, the sky is a vivid dome of black, and the view of city lights stretching as far as the eye sees is my favorite sight in the world. 

Momentarily I think I catch a flicker of a glow in the distance, as if perched atop the neutralized pile of heisters manqué, as if sitting with “her” face in “her” hands. Bored. Spacey. Vacant. Momentarily, the night isn’t starless.

“Bright young lad. Let’s chat on our way, in the meantime?”

An inexplicable tingle takes over the tip of my tongue.

“Since we have Time.”
