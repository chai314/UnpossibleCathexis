Aren't we perceptive. Did you know that most lifters here don't even know who I am nor have the slightest as to what I do, and you, we're seeing each other for what – the thirtieth time this year. More. I'm sorry? More than thirty. Wonderful. So spit it out already. You got a thing for single gymnasium insurance contractors in your area? Do you have a searing, throbbing, big gay crush on me?\nNo. Tommy now you see, I do enjoy our little meetings, I really do. Cross my cheques and hope my bank rupts. But I do tire when you give me that paucity of verbosity of a monk under oath. ... See, do you see? Stare straight into my eyes right now, Tom. I\u0026rsquo;m not here to batter your shell open like a therapist, but heed my word, the number of dumbells you\u0026rsquo;ve bent at right angles is inciting and inviting a crowd of the sort of la vie est la mort, by which I\u0026rsquo;m trying to imply that a certain set of our patrons are eager to get on the lifter-to-lyncher pipeline and would love nothing more than to be induced to it by battering your shell open. Do you know what I mean?\nI'll take them on. And I'm sorry.\rI know, Thomas, I know you\u0026rsquo;re filled with remorse and you don\u0026rsquo;t mean to pulverize our property but you just can\u0026rsquo;t help that you\u0026rsquo;re a rippling, striated, shimmering, serrated monster fourteen and a half standard deviations ahead of the curve with that body, that coruscating musculature of a classical Hero, and you just can\u0026rsquo;t help it when repressed memories effervesce their helium fumes from under sheets and sheets of your subconscious scaffolding, and the pop of the bubbles is Greek fire, napalm to your mind, ice so cold it burns, radioactive stellar bursts in an infant\u0026rsquo;s sickly yawn, the weeping venom of the widow in black now consigning to her fate in maritiphagy1, her rank tragedy the utmost kinography to Mother Nature dearest, wickedest, with malice aforementioned. So I don\u0026rsquo;t scold ya; I\u0026rsquo;m not a mother to you or anyone else for that matter. But man, you gotta get help. Pains me to do this, trust me, but it\u0026rsquo;s the bad that happens for your own good. You\u0026rsquo;re banned from all gyms in the country – don\u0026rsquo;t doubt it, I\u0026rsquo;ve got a lot of friends. As for gyms outside the country\u0026hellip; do you think The Hulk flew economy?\nI get it. I know you get it, as you always do, but let me ask you exactly what you get, as I always ask.\nNo gym. Insurance mouse at limit. Find real shrink. Insurance mouse has a name, you big, ripped oaf.\nGonna go now. See you Jerry.\rToodle-O: Bar and Diner\rPoppycock! Like \u0026rsquo;ell ahm gonna letcha thera-piss out all \u0026lsquo;ose savings, an\u0026rsquo; fowwhat? Rant\u0026rsquo;n tua shink? Lissen up tomcat, ya yap tah me and me alone, and ah don\u0026rsquo;t take two thirds of whatcha make forrit. Ya make me sayyit again an\u0026rsquo; again an\u0026rsquo; ah jus think-\nLiquor sure makes Spike chatty. My neural circuits involuntarily classify the slurred ramble as noise, killing it out from my active conscious perception.\nSo does it you, Tom.\nAh, forgive me you must, Toodles. Didn\u0026rsquo;t know I was saying that out loud. What\u0026rsquo;s the barkeep feelin\u0026rsquo; like tonight?\nShe\u0026rsquo;s makin\u0026rsquo; do and can\u0026rsquo;t complain. Tippier the tipsier they get, good customers all day round. Mm, \u0026lsquo;cept at 21 o\u0026rsquo; clock every day, though.\nT, I hate saying this, and I really regret being vague, but I was asking what you\u0026rsquo;ve got stocked to black me out tonight.\nShe balls her fist and puts it to her head, sticking her tongue out.\nThat was on you, yeah. I\u0026rsquo;ve got that fancy catnip you were meaning to try. Mozambique. You\u0026rsquo;re preoccupied today; got something on your mind?\nOnly thoughts of three Gin Catatonics2, cold as industry steel, monarchy in the Middle Ages, and a sperm whale\u0026rsquo;s habitat, respectively. And loosen that nip real well good.\nYa know whatcha problem is? Kick this ass, bury those bones. Violence, via lens. Violins! Rember… Remember Gandhi. Yeeeees. Think ahf him. Work that heada yers. Think tomcat, fer once in yer miseribble lahf. This is wah Mamma Two Shoes kicked ya out like an alley cat. Hobo.\nSo you\u0026rsquo;re cut off. Be a doll and pass me his mug? Thank you.\nOkay, I feel bad now, I honestly do. Tell me Toodles, what happens at 9?\nHappy Hour. A real happy bunch of regulars shows up. It’s a sight to see. They come in motorbikes a-skiddin\u0026rsquo;, burnt rubber kissing linoleum; hoist three sheets to the wind; order like apes in a banquet buffet, break half their plates, steal our silverware\u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s a whole circle of Hell.\nAnd you let them.\nThe capo is loaded. Wires us plenty of compensation for entertaining his halfwits. As for the other customers, well, they promptly abscond at the sortie, lickety-split. Lo, speak of the devils. You see them?\nThey’re hard to miss Toods. You’ve got a hoodlum problem. Need to put up a No Mohawks sign ‘round here. And the gin… think I’ll take the whole bottle.\nUnball that fist, Tom. You will guzzle your gins in situ, and you will turn a blind eye. I don’t want you stirring a scene that risks the preponderance of our turnover. Let me be clear: we do not defenestrate customers at the Toodle-O, especially the cash cows, no matter how cattle-like their etiquette.\nThey’re scum. I’m seething. You can’t accept this.\nScum that makes the world spin on its axis. Or this bar, at least. It’s just not your day, Tom. Put that bottle down. You should go home.\nShouldn’t I.\nCrash.\nTraintop, Moribund\rUnlimited braggadocio! Okay. I hear you, but I was saying –\nYou hear this pound? This death metal drum solo with the beats per minute of a black hummingbird’s flap. These frequencies to humanity, the chit-chat of quasars. This stampede of endorphins inundating every throbbing organ in my being. My muscles are a superheterodyne churning actin and myosin into liquid power and smoke-blue pain. I’m a reactor running on perpetual meltdown, the hull of my flesh a greenhouse dome ensnaring every ounce of obliteration I could unleash if I so willed so easily on this fragile Earth. My beloved planet. My cross to bear.\nMan, that’s cool and all, but all I’m trying to –\nI’m adamantine. My piss is the Styx. All passengers aboard, may I have your attention, please? I said please, so I presume I have it. Kindly take a gander at the spectacle by your window-sides. This is the actual, glorious Styx, flush and lush, fetched to you tonight from the vault of the Gods. All at the cost of a cheap train ride? Boy, what a deal!\nThat’s not very decent, buddy. Clearly you’re not thinking straight. Just listen to me.\nThank you, Spike! Tom thought long and hard for once in his life. Gazed into the chasm and\u0026hellip; you know what Tom saw? Mise en abyme. What Tom needs to do is stop giving a hang\u0026hellip; Et tu, Toodles? Forced me to choose between you and my moral drive. You vivisected the fiber of my being, and proceeded to throw me out\u0026hellip; just like that hag Two Shoes.\nBuddy, Tom? I’m Tom too – I’m Thomas the Tank Engine. Tom, I need you to shut up and listen clearly. I’m gonna slow down at that bend, you’re gonna hop off, and we’re gonna agree to agree that it’s just not your day.\n…Thomas. You’re me…\nZip it, I said. God. You’ve broken the locomotive law tonight more times than I can count on my cars. But no cops need to know about this scene you made atop my engine, if you just go now.\nThomas, my friend. I am the exegesis of a schizo’s magnum opus. My middle name is Bazooka. I’m a pyramid of deliriants served upon a magnifying glass. A kitty of prey, the apex, the lionized one. Thomas, I concede. From this moment on I’ll never judge, never jury, never execute. My impalpable limits will remain the only unknown, the true Beyond.\nOkay. Almost there. Be ready to take off, bud.\nWe are Brownian wisps of spidersilk in the washing machine of life. Can I confide in you, my friend? I’m honestly more sensitive than I appear. Sometimes the maelstrom evades my defenses. Sometimes the onslaught is unbearable.\nOh, join the club. Find a good shrink. We part ways here. Sayonara, tomcat.\nThomas, I’m not going.\nYou’re shitting me right now. Don’t mistake my munificence for naivety, alley cat. I could sue you till you’re silicates on the ground and throw in a holiday package behind bars for good measure.\nNo, my friend. I’m done. Will you heed my wish, Thomas, my only friend? I have truly felt tonight for once the company of an Other, on this journey with you. I want you to be my final friend, the very ultimate. I will doze off any moment now. I ask this of you, the very soul of munificence, my final friend, to be so kind as to dispose of my body when to-morrow comes. I want to go down in the midst of stinging veisalgia, as far away from this town as I can. Can you do that for me, Thomas?\nDamn it. God damn it. Why me!\n(yawn)\n…\nThomas.\nFine! I’ll do it. If that’s what it takes to get you off my back. Literally.\nWitty, my sweet railway-blazing accomplice. (yawn) Owe you for ever. Toodles can piss right off. (kiss) I love you.\nDawn, medium noctis\rYou’re awake at last. You know, I hated you at first sight. Nothing you said for the next thirty minutes helped in any manner. But when you finally slipped into slumber, curling up like a newly born kitten on my head, unkempt fur met metal, and I couldn’t help but feel… I can’t put it in words, but it made my heart churn, Tom. Guess I’m vulnerable to Stockholm, who knew. Haha. I’m just rambling, so… So. I’ve decided to cheat your last wish.\nUh, Stockholm… heart churn…\nYes! Live, Tom, for me. You’re not going anywhere on my watch. I’ll be your friend, but give me none of that “final” friend business. We’ll find you a new owner, or you could live… with me? Oh gosh… um, but only if you’re okay with that, of course. Let’s start over in this new town, Tom. Forget Toodles, forget Mamma. It’s time for Thomas and Tom. Tom and Thomas. Tommy and Tommy and a trillion adventures. Seize my metaphorical hand, Tom. Carpe diem!\nPounding his frayed expression into compliance, Tom removes the paw relieving his throbbing headache and steels himself, poising into an almighty, earth-shattering squat. The sheer impact of striking the pose sends seismic shudders quaking each lorry in the misfortunate locomotive. He heaves and he leaps, and a hundred wheels burst and give out at once. Carbon-steel donuts breathe their last in ear-bleeding screeches, sparkling in pyrotechnics, the gelid light of the End. Tom picks up torque high in the troposphere, now rotating at cyclonic speeds and yet carrying himself with the grace of a (hungover) ballet dancer or a (hungover) competitive diver. The drop in atmospheric pressure draws humongous clouds cumulonimbus from a radius of ten kilometers into an astronomical coalescing mass. With what life is left in him, the very last ounces of strength in those mechanical eyes, Thomas drinks up the resplendence of the roaring muscles and their explosive vigor, the foretold brio and handsome panache of the Torino-10 impact headed his way, and his heart flutters throughout it all.\nHow much time then passes is anyone’s guess.\nWho was that… Where the hell am I!\nIt rains.\nFootnotes\rThe act of eating one’s husband\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nCatatomic would have been a quadruple3 entendre: Cat, Tom, Atomic and Catatonic\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nTonic too, but I count it one-half.

Vagrantly, my eyes had stayed in a fateful faux-pas glued to curious marouflage: that raiment adorned with hieroglyphs and the fulgent face it accompanied, politely etching itself into my memory as I passed out in a cradle of smoke and the comfort of airbags.\nHuff. Yes, I’d love some water. That’d be H2O. Sip. Much better – thank you.\nI came to to the sight of an unknown ceiling. She sat by the bedpost, caressing crinkles in the sheets in sweet insouciance. I was told she pulled me out of the ruins of my Cadillac (okay, the Cad was dad’s, on the verge of breakdown for a preternatural decade and yet hellaciously chic for the zeitgeist. Repairs weren’t bad. Well, they were, but I digress) in a show of sheer power I could have only hoped to fathom correctly, because those slender arms and tender hands didn’t give the impression of as much as a delusion of the illusion of an iota of strength. Smidgeons for wrists perfumed with treacle; amaretto. I could have wrapped around each with a thumb and a pinkie, I swear.\nAnd quelle coïncidence, she was nineteen too. Let’s cut the gory details – there were sparks. We got together. Sip. We were tabasco of infinite zest, arson to vineyards doused in dandelions and uproarious, fiery dread, fuelled by a wick woven of scarlet Fate that seemed to rend latitudes and longitudes into fantastic shreds.\nI’m not sure, but, do you have this concept of a “reversal”, over there? And oh, no offense.\nI see. It’s rather simple – we’re attracted to impressive appearances: qualities in resonance with our biases, that float our figurative boats, are attuned to our proclivities, make us feel valid and three-dimensional and so on. It’s evolutionary; Darwinian – or your equivalent version. You get the idea. And then comes the aforementioned reversal. It’s a spectacular shift in paradigm, a real festival for the feelings when it finally occurs. No longer do you like solely the likable matter, for you\u0026rsquo;ve learned to like all that one has to offer: the quirks and idiosyncrasies, all the baggage and the issues beset.\nI reversed for her.\nShe was the Day God made the oceans so the September breeze could bear her locks adrift and season them with seaside mists. We sauntered on beaches with naked heels dipping in the wet sand, laughing ridiculously, scolding bawdy zephyrs for teasing the grip on her sunhat until the lapis lazuli dome of the sky relaxed to languid pumpkin. She was the sublime Evenfall we cleaned our ankles mutedly, replete kilns of flaring youth now mellow and warm as the dulcet tunes of the last train home dopplering into the sunset. We lay on cloth under umbrellas on the silica and quietly lunched al fresco. She was the stellar Midnight we lay there simply talking, hushing the stars to keep our secrets. Sip. Getting flustered and feelings-y, and all.\nThose glyphs on her shirt? Apparently, she’d believed with all her heart there were others like us among the stars… Aliens. Liked to deadpan that they were all sorta silly and took emotions very seriously and would brutally slaughter over a simple lie or hurt feeling. Cute as a button. I loved all her silly thoughts… I’d reversed for her after all. She saw me, thoroughly, as did I her. But she made me valid. My love peaked.\nAnd hers subdued. She’d go on rationalizing and emotionalizing and tell me how much she cared but that there was just not much left now where once stood fecund pastures of deciduous leaves. Every seventh grader knows the second law of thermodynamics, and that’s just how it is sometimes – I understood that. I wished excruciatingly she could’ve too.\nThere were, however, deciduous teeth. I wouldn’t ever know why exactly we bickered, so often we’d meta-quarrel over my alleged lack of verve in trying to beat the wind. She would supply me with reasons I’d never get, and rip out hair elaborating, and elucidating, and ultimately give up saying she’d rather have read Shakespeare to a pigeon.\nThe man’s my anathema, you see. I wish for a long and painful death, or swift and solemn demise at hands that mean me serious harm, if ever comes the day I show him the tiniest indivisible atom of reference, let alone reverence, by so much as reciting a single damned quote residing within his loquacious libraries of verbose nonsense. I would like slices of my throat to be served on a platter to starving carnivores. Cannibals would do just as well. I would like to be hung for good after a total of six failed attempts, each time a different kind of knot about my skin, geometric grids of my bruises whispering welcome to ultimate asphyxia.\nI’m not suicidal, be assured, but I fear the prospect of my brains splattering into grotesque mush would tempt me if ever were I coerced to recite him in a dark alley with pistol steel and muzzle pressing against my cranium. I loathe the man with the intensity of a supernova within a supernova presaging the ungodly, -imaginable, -fathomable implosion of everything as we know it and as we don’t and all there is and all there isn’t. But I digress. Sip.\nWe stopped feeling particularly adventurous in my Cad. Compliments were apparently hollow and patronising, how precedented. But the great miliaria rubra on my back was attempting to engage, only to be told off for space, and then informed that I had never been around when my being around was imperative. I’d stopped feeling very valid or three-dimensional for a while.\nInstead, I experienced an incomprehensible emotion. Something dark would take over my thoughts at the very sight of her, showing me gruesome aftermaths I knew could simply not be allowed to be at all. I denied them, wholly rejected them, and cursed the demons driving my mind There.\nHave you ever been There? I think I did for an instant. I saw myself in crimson and heard the incessant screeching of the stars, the constant noise of Entropy itself ripping my eardrums, tearing my mind, my brain, my very metaphysical being in shards, subdividing those shards into fragments, shattering those fragments into domains, ad naus. until I was a throbbing fractal painted in a sanguine infinity of the Universe’s true color: pain. I spent an ample attosecond There.\nI conceded. Drove my final drive through her block, past the rascal redwood I would have set alight if I’d had to stay there any longer. Never told her. It was for good, the best choice for both of us. She stood there wistfully, sentential abortions apparent in her convulsing larynx, all poignant and cinematic with puppy dog eyes finding no luck in straining for tears. A defeatist till the very end.\nThe punchline, or the epilogue, is that I don’t resent her one bit – believe it or not. Nineteen is basically kindergarten, after all. And the best mistakes are the unforgettable sort, from a pedagogical as well as a strangely makes-you-feel-fortunate-in-retrospect perspective. Besides, we loved like adults. We really saw each other. And we extinguished it with mutual respect. Put me through sixty stages of grief, really, but I wouldn’t give up these fond memories for anything.\nI can say without a doubt that true romance exists on Earth. Hell, we’d yank it into existence from up the Void’s heiney on any other planet just as well. Self-love, I say! I won’t bother with further bromides, except maybe one: Humanity is an invariant Romance, an ode to itself. I insist you learn more. Check out my bestseller, won’t you? It’s called, The Cur—\nAnd pause! Is the button the Plaintiff Attorney pushes on a clunky remote, freezing inanimate the testifying Human mid-speech. The Attorney bows in a flexible arch of slime to the dais as if to say words, words are no longer needed. The Judge of the Intergalactic Sidereal Court stands to strike four golden buzzers with brio and panache and hammers in four arms, making exuberant illumination effulgently infiltrate the exteriors and interims of the entire square-lightyear courtroom1.\nThe end of the Human’s monologue is met with trumpet fanfare as a thousand cannons burst, luminiferous projectiles duly disintegrating into billowing blooms of crescent confetti. The audience spasms and churns and gets up to run in circles clockwise, then counterclockwise, yelling “Reversal!” and grinning like apes on the bus. The glazed panel of Jurors gazes vacantly into outer space with gaping mouths ajar, their jovian taste-buds jutting. Threnodies are wailed, for this court has properly had its sentiments stirred.\nThe pathos is overwhelming, but the agents of the devil know better than to surrender their cool: Defendant Attorneys, that sly and senescent and stiff-jointed bunch is huddled into a heap trying to clutch through this tooth-and-bone crisis for their stand. Striking hot iron, the Plaintiff adjusts his slick young hair, flicking a molecule of lint off his impeccable slacks, and grabs the mic:\n“Aren’t humans droll? Every century we renew this very trial, and they prove time and again that their affective capabilities are astounding; confounding; that the top-percentile representative of their young is sufficiently developed for true emotional connection viz. Galactic Sentience Standard IEEE754. We vehemently conclude that the defendants’ bidding to use the Earth as ceremonial sacrifice for their interstellar highway project is, indubitably, immoral, and incredibly ignominious at that.”\nIt seems that legal speech excites no audience in the universe. The Plaintiff goes at it again for at least a crumb of clout:\n“We plead for cessation of further renewals of this trial. Shan’t we vie to finally lift this recurring curse from the Solar system’s youngest planet? Defendants will resort to conservative excuses, like galactic heritage and the preservation thereof. We reinforce and urge the necessity of putting one of the older planets on the altar.”\n“Enough has been said. Do the Defendants wish to leave their huddle yet?” thunders the loudest voice in the courtroom.\n“They… We do, milord. We wish to mildly interrogate the top-percentile.”\n“Sustained. Let him be unpaused.”\n“Mr ■■■.”\n“Yes, spaceman? No offense, there.”\n“None taken here. We’d like to know just a little about your adventures in love.”\n“Sweet. An interview.”\n“Especially your inspiring capacity for true emotional connection.”\n“Don’t embarrass me now. Shoot.”\n“Verily. Among all the adulation, it seems that this court didn’t learn much about Ms ○○○ at all.”\n“Who?”\n“Mister ■■■?”\n“\u0026hellip;”\n“\u0026hellip;”\n“Who else! Just an Earth joke for you, ha…”\n“\u0026hellip;”\n“ \u0026hellip;Kinda nippy here, eh?”\n“Yes.” The court falls silent, lifeless, transfixed with a gaze feral as the Universe.\n“What’s in a name, as they say back Home.”\nFootnotes #\r(unfortunately for those in the back rows, the festivities will reach them in 1.122 years or less)\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n√5/2, the length of a ray emanating at 26.5° from a unit square’s vertex\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":"13 March 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/UnpossibleCathexis/posts/coy/","section":"","summary":"Manthan 2024 - Entry","title":"Curse of Youth - Manthan","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"13 March 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/UnpossibleCathexis/tags/outer-space/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Outer Space","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"13 March 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/UnpossibleCathexis/tags/shakespeare/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Shakespeare","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"13 March 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/UnpossibleCathexis/categories/uwu-whats-this/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Uwu What's This","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/UnpossibleCathexis/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/UnpossibleCathexis/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
